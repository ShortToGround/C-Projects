# C Projects
All of my C Projects are compiled with -Wall and -Wextra in order to try and write "best practice" code.

I try to make all of my code as portable as possible. My main focuses are Windows and \*nix though.

I compile my programs on both Windows (using MSVC cl.exe) and Debian (using GCC and Clang).
